# Figures

This folder contains all the figures used in the article, including both manually created and AI-generated visualizations.

### Manual Figures
1. **LLMs Figure**: This figure was manually created to illustrate the concept of Large Language Models (LLMs). 
2. **Flower Chart**: A manually designed chart that visualizes Application Categories.

### AI-Generated Figure
- **Healthcare ecosystem**: This figure was created using a prompt on [Napkin.ai](https://www.napkin.ai/), an AI tool that generates high-quality images based on descriptive input. 
**Sample Prompt**: "We are conducting a study focused on the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various healthcare domains, aiming to create a visual representation of a healthcare ecosystem centered around the patient's journey. The ecosystem begins with the patient and progresses through a series of key steps in the treatment process, with each step representing a distinct healthcare domain. These steps include (1) Informatin Support, (2) Patient Addmission, (3) Patient Assessment, (4) Medical Examination, (5) Disease Screening and Diagnosis, (6) Disease Managemenet, and (7) Aftercare Communication and Documentation. We would like each of these actions to be visualized separately with distinct icons to illustrate the flow of patient care from start to finish."
